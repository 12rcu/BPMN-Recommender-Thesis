\section{Motivation}

Every business has processes, and with scale these processes become more complex, making business process modelling (BPM) increasingly important today \cite{bpmComparison}.

% Business process modelling (BPM) is becoming increasingly important these days as it's an effective way of modelling business processes that every company has \cite{bpmComparison}.

Business process modelling can help to analyse and visualise a process to gain a better understanding of the established process in a business environment. To get this overview, it is sometimes necessary to learn the specific notation used to get the full picture of what is happening.

Today, there is an abundance of business process modelling methods available \cite{bpm_survey}. \cite{bpm_review_framework} has already noticed that the decision on which notation to use is quite difficult, as each process has different requirements on the BPM notation in order to convey what is important. \cite{bpm_review_framework} has also created a table with characteristics of the most common notations to help decide which notation to use.

\section{Objective}

By addressing the problem of deciding which BPM notation to use, the aim of this paper is to provide the BPM notation with the help of a recommender system. This is done by rating certain nations and based on these ratings a recommendation for unrated BPM notations is given. In this way, a user can be recommended a BPM notation they may never have heard of.

The scope of the recommender is an Application Programmable Interface (API) and not a full application with an user interface and/or user experience (UI/UX).
