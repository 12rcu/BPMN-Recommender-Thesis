\chapter{Requirements Checking}

\label{chap:check_req}

In this chapter we check whether the functional and non-functional requirements defined in Chapter 4 have been met. An additional column is added to indicate whether the requirement has been met (+), partially met (0) or not met (-).

\section{Checking the Functional Requirements}

    \hline
	  FR & Name & Description & +/0/-\\
    \hline
    NFR 1 & Performance & The software shouldn't take more then 1gb of RAM and should minimize network traffic. & +\\
    \hline
    NFR 2 & Testing & The software should test all similarity and recommendation algorithms in a meaningful way, including unexpected input data. & +\\
    \hline
    NFR 3 & Usage & The API should be easy for a potential developer to use through intuitive routes, query parameters and API documentation. & +\\
    \hline
    NFR 4 & Extensions & The software should be extensible with more similarity measures. & +\\
