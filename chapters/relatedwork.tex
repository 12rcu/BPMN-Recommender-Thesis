In this section we will talk about related work, mainly similar ideas and additional work that may further develop this paper.


\cite{similarity-bpm} carried out an analysis of similar business process modelling notations to find duplicates in an existing system. \cite{similarity-bpm}'s approach was to look at the characteristics of the different business process modelling notations. In this paper we don't look at these
and focus only on user ratings, although content-based filtering may be a possible development in the future.

The drawback on characterising business process modelling notations is to find charactersitics that all notations can achive or not.
The most common business process modelling characteristics were summarised by \cite{bpm_review_framework}. These characteristics could be fed into a recommender system to make a content-based recommendation.

\cite{zimochMentalLoad} conducted a sample study to determine the mental load of eight commonly used business process modelling notations. This analysis can also be used for a feature within the recommender system.
